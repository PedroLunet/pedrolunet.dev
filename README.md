# pedrolunet.dev

This is my personal website, built with SvelteKit. It is still under development.

## Running locally

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or, to start the server and open the app in a new browser tab:

```sh
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building for production

To create a production version of the site:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with:

```sh
npm run preview
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
