		"description": "An exploration of digital brutalism and Swiss design principles. Built using my favourite web framework, Svelte, and experimenting with motion using GSAP. This site prioritizes raw information density, strict grid adherence, and typographic hierarchy over decorative elements. A performant canvas for my projects and thoughts.\n\nI started this project because my previous portfolio didn't feel authentic to my identity and failed to showcase my work the way I envisioned. I wanted to create a space that felt more personal and reflected my design sensibilities, while pushing Svelte 5 to its limits in terms of performance and interactivity.",
